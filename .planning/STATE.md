# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-06-24)

**Core value:** A user can control their Tuya devices in HomeKit after a simple Smart Life QR login — no per-user Tuya developer account.
**Current focus:** Phase 1 — Project Scaffolding & TDD Gates

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 7 (Project Scaffolding & TDD Gates)
Plan: 0 of TBD in current phase
Status: Ready to plan
Last activity: 2026-06-24 — Roadmap created (7 phases, 27 v1 requirements mapped)

Progress: [░░░░░░░░░░] 0%

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: Phase 1 is the mandated first step — scaffolding + TDD harness, itself exempt from the test-first rule it establishes.
- [Roadmap]: The credential/auth question is resolved in Phase 2 BEFORE any device work; HA's credential is a throwaway probe, never shipped.
- [Roadmap]: Phase 6 (polling + offline) is the MVP ship point; MQTT push and lights/covers/scenes are deferred to v2.

### Pending Todos

[From .planning/todos/pending/ — ideas captured during sessions]

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

[Issues that affect future work]

- [Phase 2]: Tuya partner gating is the project-defining unknown. If a legitimate `client_id`/`schema` cannot be obtained, auth pivots to the developer-project API fallback — but scaffolding (Phase 1) is reused regardless.
